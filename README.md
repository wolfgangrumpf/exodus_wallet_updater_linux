# exodus_wallet_updater_linux
A bash script to update the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet for linux.
Tested on Ubuntu 22.10

This script requires that you have lynx installed.  

I was annoyed with the way the Exodus team had auto-updaters for Mac and Windows but not for Ubuntu.
So I wrote my own.  It may be a bit kludgy, but it works.

Probably the best way to implement this is to store it in a scripts folder and add it to your crontab
for daily execution.
